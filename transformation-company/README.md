## How to use it

 To entry data and start a battle is pretty simple!
Each line must have a transform name followed by a letter to represent his team - (A) Autobots, (D) Decepticons - and all attributes in this order: Strength, Intelligence, Speed, Endurance, Rank, Courage, Firepower and Skill. All this must be separeted by comma. See the example:

```
Soundwave, D, 8,9,2,6,7,5,6,10
Bluestreak, A, 6,6,7,9,5,2,9,7
Hubcap, A, 4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4
```
